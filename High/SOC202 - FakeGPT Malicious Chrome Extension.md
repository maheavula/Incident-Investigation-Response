---

### 4. **Checking Device Quarantine Status**  
Review the **endpoint security** to determine if the device is quarantined. As the device is **not quarantined**, select **"Not Quarantined"**.  

---

### 5. **Analyzing the Extension File**  
Analyze the suspicious extension file using online sandbox tools to determine its behavior:  

- **VirusTotal**: No vendors flagged the extension as malicious.  
![VirusTotal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f95d27a-da4f-44ca-9421-33ab7da1b71d)  

- **Hybrid Analysis**: Declared the extension **clean**, with no signs of malicious behavior.  
![Hybrid Analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5a7bee7-735f-4235-8003-44f83721d332)  

- **ANY.RUN**: Confirmed **no threat detected**.  

---

### 6. **Investigating Logs for Malicious Behavior**  
Although sandbox analysis shows the extension as **clean**, **log management** reveals HTTP requests from the host device to two suspicious IP addresses:  
- **18.140.6.45**  
- **52.76.101.124**  

![Raw Logs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f36678c-a0e9-4df9-9b16-6b62976da678)  
![Raw Log](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8a89dde-489b-4244-860b-ad6ea5100624)  

These requests are suspicious because the domain differs from the legitimate **ChatGPT** domain. This indicates **malicious behavior**.  

---

### 7. **Confirming C2 Access**  
Further log analysis confirms that the host device accessed a **Command-and-Control (C2)** address. Both browser history and logs show evidence of interaction with the malicious domain. Select **"Accessed"** to confirm this behavior.

---

### 8. **Containing the Host Device**  
To prevent further compromise, the host device must be **contained**. Use **endpoint security** tools to isolate the device from the network.
