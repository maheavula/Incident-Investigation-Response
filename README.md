# Incident and Investigation Response

This repository documents my hands-on experiences in **Incident Response and Investigation** on the [LetsDefend](https://letsdefend.io/) platform. Each incident is thoroughly investigated following industry-standard playbooks and categorized based on alert severity: **Critical**, **High**, and **Medium**. Each alert will be documented with an in-depth walkthrough to assess whether it is a **True Positive (TP)** or **False Positive (FP)**.

### **Tips for Writing Effective Walkthroughs**

1. **Be Concise, Yet Detailed**: Avoid jargon or unnecessary complexity. Ensure your findings and steps are clear and understandable.  
2. **Link Tools and Resources**: Provide links to tools like VirusTotal, Shodan, etc., when mentioning them.  
3. **Use Screenshots (if allowed)**: Adding screenshots (e.g., from dashboards or SIEM tools) can help illustrate key points.  
4. **Document the Timeline**: When possible, note timestamps of key events to align with your findings.  
5. **Highlight Challenges and Solutions**: If you encounter difficulties, document how you overcame them.
